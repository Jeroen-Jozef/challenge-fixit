# Group-challenge
## Who are we?


Badr Hjij, Tim Broos, Mouad Soufiani, Liam Selleslagh, Rafah Alani en Jeroen Hendrickx.


## What is the purpose of this repo

A group challenge combining knowledge gained so far. In the first weeks we've seen HTML, CSS, Git, SASS and Bootstrap. Combining these technologies we made a website for an events organisation called **Fixit**. We are using github so everybody can see how far we have progressed. Maybe somebody will hire us!
