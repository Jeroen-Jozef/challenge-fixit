Help with HTML, CSS and Javascript to some extent. But in fact, feel free to ask me whatever is bothering you and I'll see if I can help out.

## Funny story

A few days ago I was having trouble with me ecard reader. Trying to fix it, swearing, calling helpdesk even, which is not something I usually do. Erm... I had inserted the card upside down.

### TL;DR

If that was too long to read, I suggest you follow other classes first ;-)
